# Group 31 - {RFM Analysis}

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

There were three topics we could choose from: e-commerce, global suicide rate, and terrorist attacks around the world. Because finance is an interesting field for all of us, we decided to explore e-commerce datasets. Looking further, we determined that we wanted to segment customers based on RFM models. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer's behavior because the frequency and monetary value affect a customer's lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement. As a result of working on this project, we will all gain experience with customer data. Based on the same principles as an RFM analysis for a project, this experience can be applied to local businesses to analyze their buyers and create a profitable approach for them.
